The 'ion wallet' is my bitcoin wallet designed specifically to make creating and using Bitcoin Wills very simple. It is still in the process of development and debugging.
Bitcoin's value is in its security. In order for a wallet to be trusted, the code must be refined, tested, and peer reviewed by the greater Bitcoin developer community. Keeping the code open-source is the best way to ensure this.
